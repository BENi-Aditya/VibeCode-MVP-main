- Implemented continuous conversation loop with automatic speech detection
- Added real-time audio visualization using Web Audio API
- Improved voice circle UI with centered positioning and symmetric outlines
- Fixed syntax errors in voice mode implementation

## Project Overview

## Core Concept
"You describe your idea, the AI builds the plan, suggests the tech stack, sets up the environment, and even starts coding for you."

Users chat with an AI assistant inside a dual-pane workspace:

Left Pane (Chat Interface) â€” Conversational interface where users describe their project idea naturally.

Right Pane (Technical Blueprint Panel) â€” A structured, dynamic panel where the AI progressively builds a detailed technical blueprint of the user's project.
**VibeCode** is an innovative AI-powered development assistant designed to streamline the software development process through intelligent ideation, environment setup, and collaborative coding.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TailwindCSS
- **UI Components**: ShadCN UI + custom glassmorphism
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API (GPT-4.1 nano / 3.5)
- **Backend**: Node.js / FastAPI (TBD)
- **Deployment**: Render.com
- **Auth (future)**: Supabase or Clerk (optional)

### Initial Concept (MVP Development)
- **Core Focus**: Ideation and Development workspaces
- **UI Design**: 
  - Sidebar for mode selection
  - Split-screen chat and progress interface
- **AI Integration Goals**:
  - Natural language processing
  - Project planning assistance
  - Environment setup recommendations

### UI/UX Development Phases

#### Phase 1: Basic Interface
- Created foundational React components
- Implemented workspace sidebar
- Designed initial chat interface
- Added basic state management

#### Phase 2: AI Chat Interface Enhancements
- Implemented Markdown parsing for AI responses
- Added multi-line text input support
- Created "New Chat" functionality
- Developed voice interaction mode

### Key Features Implemented

#### Chat Interface
- Real-time messaging with AI
- Markdown rendering for rich text responses
- Responsive design
- Voice input/output capabilities

#### Voice Mode
- Speech-to-text conversion
- Automatic message processing
- Text-to-speech response generation
- Continuous conversation mode

#### Workspace Management

- Error handling for API responses
- Fallback mechanisms for API failures
- Model selection (GPT-3.5, GPT-4.1 nano)

#### User Experience
- Custom cursor implementation
- Responsive design
- Accessibility considerations
- Smooth state transitions

### Development Environment

#### Configuration
- Vite as build tool
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Environmental variable management

#### Key Dependencies
- `react-markdown` for rich text rendering
- Lucide icons for UI elements
- Radix UI for accessible components

### Future Roadmap
- Complete Blueprint Generation API development
- Finalize AI prompt fine-tuning
- Implement blueprint display integration
- Add collaboration features
- Develop deployment capabilities

## Deployment Considerations
- Netlify/Vercel deployment ready
- Environment variable management
- Performance optimization

## Security Notes
- API key management
- Secure handling of AI interactions
- Client-side data protection

## Contribution Guidelines
1. Follow TypeScript best practices
2. Maintain consistent styling with Tailwind
3. Write comprehensive tests
4. Document new features

## Known Limitations
- Current voice mode dependent on browser support
- API call limitations based on OpenAI quota
- Limited to web-based interaction

## Troubleshooting
- Check browser console for detailed logs
- Verify OpenAI API key and quota
- Ensure stable internet connection
